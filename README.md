# Churn prediction with pyspark
This project presents a churn predictive model built using using the public data available at www.iainpardoe.com/teaching/dsc433/data/Churn.xls

Specifically, the Random Forest algorithm is employed to build the predictive model. Moreover, grid search has been performed to tune the parameters of the model. The complete code is available in the jupyter notebook file (**churn analytics.ipynb**).
