# Churn prediction
This project presents a churn predictive model built using pyspark. The churn prediction is performed using a public dataset **"Churn.csv"**. Specifically, the Random Forest algorithm is employed to build the model. Moreover, grid search has been performed to tune the parameters of the model. The complete code is available in the jupyter notebook file (**churn analytics.ipynb**).
